	<p>Sample for a questionnaire</p>

		<li>I was studying the postures in which people use toilets</li>
		<li>I wanted a sample of students</li>
		<li>My university had a public database of all student, faculty and alumni email addresses.</li>

What proportion of people have middle initials?

Thank you for using the US Census Bureau's Question and Answer Center. Un-
fortunately, the subject you asked about is not one for which the Census
Bureau collects data. We are sorry we were not able to assist you.

	<h2>Middle names</h2>
	<p>The Census couldn't tell me, so I looked at that university database</p>
	<img src="images/cornell_middle_names_by_school.png" alt="A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University students shows that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the proportion varies substantially by school, the graduate school having a particularly low rate of middle names and the agriculture school having a particularly high rate.">
	<p>Two-thirds had middle names.</p>

	<p>A few months ago, I looked at this again with all dead Americans</p>

	<h2>Cleaning the data is not the point</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Cleaning the data can be most of the work.</li>
		<li>I really just want to analyze the cleaned data.</li>

	<h2>My work at ScraperWiki</h2>
	<p>We're making a platform to make data projects easier.</p>

		<li>Simplify computer infrastructure so you don't have to learn it.</li>
		<li>Automatically provide obvious tools: scheduling, a web API, &c.</li>

		<li>Start with a small part of that job.</li>
		<li>Unsophisticated programs can get you pretty far.</li>
		<li>Use existing software libraries so you don't have to write your own</li>
		<li>If you can't get the data you want, come up with an alternative.</li>
