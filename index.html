	<p>More specifically</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You apply for a permit build on the wetlands in the United States.</li>
		<li>The Army Corps of Engineers can approve permits that meet certain criteria.</li>
		<li>I have no idea how the Army got this job.</li>
		<li>The Army, understandably, doesn't scrutinize permits as much as the Gulf Restoration Network would like.</li>

		<p>In the past, <a href="http://healthygulf.org/images/who_we_are/staff/Scott_headshot2.jpg">Scott</a> has had to do this manually. But he doesn't really have time for that.</p>
		<p>We're using a computer program to make the first two of these steps easier.</p>

	<p>It also</p>
	<ul>
		<li>runs automatically every day</li>
		<li>saves all of the files</li>
		<li>checks for changes in files</li>
		<li>produces a spreadsheet of the extracted information</li>
		<li>hosts all of this on a website that Scott can access</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We're still working out the kinks, but the initial goal is that Scott will be able to use the spreadsheet to quickly
		find notices that he should look into further. Then he'll read the notice and take whatever actions make sense.

	<h2>Ergonomics research</h2>
	<p>In school, I studied how people use computers and toilets (not at the same time)</p>
	<p>Scripts for</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tidying data</li>
		<li>Running models</li>

	<h2>Ergonomics research</h2>
	<p>Sample for a questionnaire</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I was studying the postures in which people use toilets</li>
		<li>I wanted a sample of students</li>
		<li>My university had a public database of all student, faculty and alumni email addresses.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Frivolity</h1>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>Middle names</h2>
	<p>While selecting the sample for that toilet study, I started wondering how many people have middle names.</p>
	<p>I asked the US Census.</p>
	<pre>
Subject
---------------------------------------------------------------
What proportion of people have middle initials?

Thank you for using the US Census Bureau's Question and Answer Center. Un-
fortunately, the subject you asked about is not one for which the Census
Bureau collects data. We are sorry we were not able to assist you.

	<h2>Middle names</h2>
	<p>The Census couldn't tell me, so I looked at that university database</p>
	<img src="images/cornell_middle_names_by_school.png" alt="A plot of middle name prevalence by school among Cornell University students shows that 15824 students had middle names and 6649 not and that the proportion varies substantially by school, the graduate school having a particularly low rate of middle names and the agriculture school having a particularly high rate.">
	<p>Two-thirds had middle names.</p>

<section class="slide">
	<h2>Middle names</h2>
	<p>A few months ago, I looked at this again with all dead Americans</p>

	<h2>What is the point?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I use numbers to learn about how people work.</li>
		<li>If I had clean data, the analysis would be easy.</li>
